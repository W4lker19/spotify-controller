## Features

### Premium UI & Glassmorphism Design

A visual experience unlike any other GNOME extension.

- **Translucent Glass Look** - The popup, buttons, and lists all feature a sleek glassmorphic effect that adapts beautifully to light and dark wallpapers
- **Dynamic Ambient Background** - Dominant colors are extracted from the current track's cover art and applied as a live gradient across the popup
- **Spinning Cover Art** - Album art rotates like a vinyl record while music plays; speed and radius are fully adjustable in settings
- **Polished Hover Effects** - Every button and list item has smooth, custom hover states - YouTube Red on "Play All", Vibrant Purple on "Shuffle", Soft Red on the Heart icon

### Real Spotify Playlist Manager

Manage your actual Spotify library, right from the panel. *(Requires linking your account once — see [Connecting Your Spotify Account](#connecting-your-spotify-account).)*

- **Your Real Playlists** - Browse, create, rename, and delete (unfollow) the playlists in your Spotify account
- **Quick Add** - Save the currently playing song to any playlist instantly with the `+` button
- **Smart Search** - A search bar automatically appears once a list grows beyond 5 items, so you can filter fast
- **Track Intelligence** - Each playlist displays its song count and total playback time (e.g., `5 songs • 19 min`)

> **Note:** Everything syncs directly with your Spotify account via the Spotify Web API. Creating a playlist, adding a song, or tapping the heart updates your real library.

### Liked Songs System

Your favorites, always one tap away.

- **In-Player Heart Button** - A dedicated Heart icon next to the playback slider saves the current track to Liked Songs with a single click; the icon glows with a glassy soft-red color when active
- **Dedicated Liked Songs Page** - A separate section collects all your favorite tracks in one easy-to-access list

> **Note:** The heart syncs with your real Spotify **Liked Songs** — liking here saves to your account, and songs you've already liked on Spotify show up in the list.

### Smart Playback & Queue Control

Full control over what plays and when.

- **Direct Play** - Clicking any song in a playlist or Liked Songs instantly triggers playback in Spotify
- **Play All & Shuffle** - Every playlist has dedicated action buttons at the top to play in order or at random
- **Full Media Controls** - Play, Pause, Next, Previous, and Repeat, all wired up and ready
- **Smooth Seek Slider** - A buttery-smooth progress slider lets you seek precisely through any track
- **Volume Slider & Mute** - Adjust volume from an in-popup slider with a one-click mute toggle (or scroll on the panel)
- **Sleep Timer** - Tap the alarm icon to auto-pause playback after 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes

### Real-Time Synchronized Lyrics

One click to sing along.

- **One-Click Overlay** - Tap the cover art to instantly transition to a synchronized lyrics view; tap again to return
- **Auto-Scroll** - Lyrics scroll automatically in sync with the track's current timestamp - no manual interaction needed
- **Click to Seek** - Tap any lyric line to jump playback straight to that moment
- **Manual Scroll** - Scroll through the lyrics yourself with the mouse wheel; it auto-resumes following the song after a few seconds

### Desktop Notifications

- **Track-Change Toasts** - Optionally show a desktop notification with cover art whenever the song changes (enable in Preferences → Behavior)

### Smart Backend & Optimization

Fast, lean, and built to last.

- **Secure Account Link** - Your Spotify connection uses OAuth (PKCE); access tokens refresh automatically and the extension never sees your password
- **Image Caching** - Cover art is cached to a `.cache` folder after the first download, saving bandwidth and reducing RAM usage on every subsequent play
- **Auto Garbage Collector** - Old, unused cached images are silently purged over time, keeping your storage clean

### Deep Customization

Open the Spotify Controller preferences to fine-tune everything:

- Customize fonts, font sizes, and text colors
- Adjust button spacing, margins, and icon sizes
- Toggle the vinyl rotation animation for cover art
- Choose between **Wavy** or **Straight** progress slider styles with custom thickness, speed, and colors
- Reposition the panel widget to the Left, Center, or Right side
- Show or hide individual panel buttons independently

## Connecting Your Spotify Account

Playlists and Liked Songs use the Spotify Web API, so you link a free Spotify app **once**:

1. Open the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and click **Create app** (free).
2. In the app's **Settings**, add this exact **Redirect URI**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
   ```
3. Copy the app's **Client ID**.
4. Open **Spotify Controller Preferences → General → Spotify Account**, paste the Client ID, and click **Connect**.
5. Approve access in the browser — the row updates to *"Connected as &lt;you&gt;"*.

> Creating playlists and saving Liked Songs work on **free** Spotify accounts. Playback runs through your local Spotify app (MPRIS), so it works regardless of plan. The Client ID is public to the PKCE flow and is stored locally; the extension never sees your password.
